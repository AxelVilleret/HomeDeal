# HomeDeal

## Description

This project was also an opportunity for me to take a big step in application development.

It is an Android application developed in Kotlin and based on Firebase for the backend. It allowed me to acquire an ease in asynchronous programming, but also to apply concepts seen during my training (advanced management of exceptions and use of interfaces in particular). I also exploited the advanced features of Firebase to trigger backend tasks at regular time intervals and set up an automated notification system.

This application refers to the famous Dealabs, which allows, on the basis of user accounts, to create, share good deals found online and view the most loved by the community.
